        <h2>Why Univeral Design ?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="body_body_text">
        <p>Diversity is part of the richness of life. There’s even evidence that differ-
ences in human brains and how we perceive the world are as essential as
biodiversity is to the rich ecosystem of plants and animals. Diversity brings
strength and resilience. Designing for a wide range of people, including those with disabilities,
ensures that everyone can participate with other through Universal Design.

        <h3><b>Poor Color Contrast</b></h3>
        <p>People with limited vision or color blindness cannot read text if there is not enough contrast between the text and background (for example, light gray text on a light-colored background).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>Use of Color Alone to Give Information</b></h3>
        <p>People who are color-blind may not have access to information when that information is conveyed using only color cues because they cannot distinguish certain colors from others. Also, screen readers do not tell the user the color of text on a screen, so a person who is blind would not be able to know that color is meant to convey certain information (for example, using red text alone to show which fields are required on a form).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>Lack of Text Alternatives ("Alt Text") on Images</b></h3>
        <p>People who are blind will not be able to understand the content and purpose of images, such as pictures, illustrations, and charts, when no text alternative is provided. Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>No Captions on Videos</b></h3>
        <p>People with hearing disabilities may not be able to understand information communicated in a video if the video does not have captions.</p>
