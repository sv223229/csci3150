        <p>My personal Pick for Game of the Year is Expedition33. The game offer a new refreshing on turn based game by using souls like mechanic such as parrying or dodging from game like sekiro or Darksoul.
        The game have a great story line with interesting character development and insane plot twist that keep player questionning about the mystery throughout the whole game. The game also have a great art style and an absolute banger of an soundtrack that bring the overall experience.
        To another level. The game is defenitely once in a generation game.
