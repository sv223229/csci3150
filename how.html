        <h2>How to Univeral Design ?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="body_body_text">
        <p>Think about a building. Public buildings do not generally provide wheel-
chairs for users with limited mobility. However, they are constructed so
that visitors using wheelchairs can get around. Similarly, designers need
to anticipate the needs of visitors to their websites and web applications
and make sure that the necessary features are available to those who
need them. A good way to approach this is to think about the individuality
of different types of users and then consider what each individual might do.

        <h3><b>Review Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</b></h3>
        <p>WCAG are standards that influence federal, state, and local policies that may dictate accessibility requirements for websites, so it's important to check that your organization is compliant. The World Wide Web Consortium and Web Accessibility Initiative also develop standards and publicly available support materials to help you understand and implement accessibility.</p>

    <div>
        <h3><b>1. Understand the Definition</b></h3>
        <p>Web accessibility means designing so people with disabilities can use your website. The Internet is ingrained in our everyday lives, and websites that can interact correctly with accessibility tools are critical to making the Internet available to people with disabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>2. Be Aware of Common Issues</b></h3>
        <p>These include media files and images that don't have descriptive title and Alt tags, text on backgrounds without enough contrast for people to read, moving/flashing elements that aren't clearly identifiable, or forms and input fields that aren't accessible to people with visual impairments or who rely on screen readers.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>3. Evaluate Your Website</b></h3>
        <p>There are tools and plug-ins available to help you evaluate website accessibility or replicate the experiences of users operating the website through accessibility tools. Check out our blog post to try these evaluation tools out!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><b>4. Prioritize Accessibility</b></h3>
        <p>Whether you're building a website now or updating a years-old one, incorporate accessibility reviews both to avoid isolating a portion of your audience, and to ensure compliance with laws. Include and budget for accessibility checks in your regular website maintenance plan.</p>
